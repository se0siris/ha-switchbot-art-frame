"""Putting a new image on the frame without the phone app.

1. Tidy up: remove cloud album entries for images no longer on the frame. If
   the cloud album is full of uploads the frame never downloaded, remove the
   oldest of them; if the frame is full, delete its oldest image (frame and
   cloud).
2. Upload the image to SwitchBot's cloud (public Cloud API).
3. Find the ID the cloud gave it (private album API).
4. Tell the frame over Bluetooth to download that ID; it fetches the image
   over its own Wi-Fi.
